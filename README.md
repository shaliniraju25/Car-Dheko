# Car Dekho - Used Car Price Prediction 🚗

# Project Overview 📚
This project focuses on developing an interactive, predictive tool for determining the price of used cars based on various factors. Leveraging machine learning and the data from Car Dekho, we aim to create a robust model for accurate price prediction, deployed as a Streamlit application. This tool is designed to streamline the car pricing process for both customers and sales representatives, enhancing the car-buying and selling experience.


# Skills and Techniques 🚀
1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.Machine Learning Model Development
4.Price Prediction Techniques
5.Model Evaluation and Optimization
6.Model Deployment with Streamlit
7.Documentation and Reporting


# Problem Statement 📝
Objective: Build an intuitive and accurate predictive tool that estimates the prices of used cars based on various features (e.g., make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and city). This tool is deployed as an interactive web application on Streamlit, enabling both customers and sales representatives to seamlessly predict car prices in real time.

Project Scope: Car Dheko’s historical dataset provides essential car features from different cities. The task is to process this data, build a machine learning model for price prediction, and deploy the model as a Streamlit web app.


# Business Use Cases 💼
Enhanced Customer Experience: Offers customers easy access to realistic price estimates.
Sales Optimization: Helps sales representatives set competitive prices based on accurate data.
Operational Efficiency: Enables streamlined pricing processes, minimizing manual assessments.
Informed Decision-Making: Provides insights for strategic planning based on predictive analysis.

# Approach 🔍

# Data Processing:
Concatenation: Import and merge datasets from various cities into a unified format.
Missing Value Treatment: Handle missing values with imputation or by creating new categories.
Data Standardization: Ensure consistent formatting (e.g., converting "70 kms" to numerical).
Categorical Encoding: Apply One-Hot or Label Encoding for categorical variables.
Feature Scaling: Normalize numerical features as required.
Outlier Removal: Remove or cap outliers to maintain data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Summarize key statistics for each variable.
Data Visualization: Use plots (scatter, box, histogram, etc.) to uncover trends.
Feature Selection: Identify influential features impacting price prediction.
